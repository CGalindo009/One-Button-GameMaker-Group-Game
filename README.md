# One-Button-GameMaker-Group-Game
My version of a collaboration on a one button game for my FLC course.

Currently Complete:
  1. Player model animations
  2. Both actions in response to different states of button. (Moves forward if pressed, attacks if held)
  3. Enemies and their projectiles.
  4. Different states of collision between player character being in attack and idle animations.
  
In Progress:
  Nothing at the moment.
  
Need to Do:
  1. Compare progress with group mates and combine games into final one.
  2. Music????
