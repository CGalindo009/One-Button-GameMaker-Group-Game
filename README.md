# One-Button-GameMaker-Group-Game
My version of a collaboration on a one button game for my FLC course.

Currently Complete:
  1. Player model animations
  2. Both actions in response to different states of button. (Moves forward if pressed, attacks if held)
  
In Progress:
  1. Enemies and their projectiles.
  
Need to Figure Out:
  1. Different states of collision between player character being in attack and idle animations.
  2. If idle, player character is destroyed from the collision and the level restarts.
  3. If attack, player character destroys the incoming projectiles or the enemy.
